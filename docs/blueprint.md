# **App Name**: TestGenius

## Core Features:

- GitHub Integration & File Listing: Integrate with GitHub to list code files in a user-friendly UI.
- Test Case Summary Generation: Generates a summary list of suggested JUnit test cases using AI for selected files.  The AI tool will decide which test cases are appropriate to generate.

- Pull Request Creation: Allow users to select generated test code files for commit to GitHub as part of a pull request.
